# Masked Quiz

The [maskedquiz.com](https://maskedquiz.com) is a game. An example for how to use [Wapplr](https://github.com/wapplr/wapplr), 
and a funny game, try it! I made it recently, itâ€™s pretty current!

#### How to play

1. Enter a username, that if you have enough score, you can be there to the high scores. The system automatically generates a funny name if you don't feel like typing your own.
2. Start the game. Guess who is under the mask. You have a few seconds to answer, so you need to hurry.
3. If you add a wrong answer or time runs out, you will lose a life. After three wrong answers, the game is over.
4. Then you can see the high scores, and your results. Here can you restart the game.
